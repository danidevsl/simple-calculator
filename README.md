# Simple Calculator

A **Simple Calculator** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project is designed to provide a basic and easy-to-use calculator interface that performs standard arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculation. Additionally, it includes a floating button that allows users to return to my [portfolio](https://portifolio-danilo-jorge.netlify.app/).
